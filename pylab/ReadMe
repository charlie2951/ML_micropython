In Thonny, paste Linear/Logistic regression code predent inside pylab folder. Save the code as same name as it is inside a folder in RP2040. The folder name must be "pylab".
Don't forget to place the _init_.py file inside that folder.
Now you can run test files by calling the limrary "from pylab import logistic_regression as lm" in this way.
